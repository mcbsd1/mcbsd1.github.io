## Day 4 - Cell-type Identification and Trajectory Analysis in Seurat

---

### Recap from Day 3
---
---

- On 27th Feb, we covered:
  - Integrating single-cell datasets.
  - Differential Gene Expression analysis and marker selection.
  - Cell-type annotation using CellMarker.

- Today we will cover:
  - Cell-type annotation using SingleR.
  - Trajectory analysis (pseudotime analysis) using monocle3

### Cell-type annotation using SingleR
---
---

**What is SingleR?**

- SingleR is an automatic annotation method for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data.
- Given a reference dataset of samples (single-cell or bulk) with known labels, it labels new cells from a test dataset based on similarity to the reference.
- The burden of manually interpreting clusters and defining marker genes only has to be done once.
- This biological knowledge can be propagated to new datasets in an automated manner.

#### Using built-in references
---

- The easiest way to use SingleR is to annotate cells against built-in references.
- The `celldex` package provides access to several reference datasets.

**General-purpose references**
- Human primary cell atlas (HPCA): Publicly available microarray datasets derived from human primary cells.
- Blueprint/ENCODE: Bulk RNA-seq data for pure stroma and immune cells generated by Blueprint and ENCODE projects.
- Mouse RNA-seq: Collection of mouse bulk RNA-seq data sets downloaded from the gene expression omnibus.

**Immune references**
- Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen): Consists of microarray profiles of pure mouse immune cells.
- Database of Immune Cell Expression/eQTLs/Epigenomics (DICE): The `DICE` reference consists of bulk RNA-seq samples of sorted cell populations.
- Novershtern hematopoietic data: The Novershtern reference (previously known as Differentiation Map) consists of microarray datasets for sorted hematopoietic cell populations from GSE24759.
- Monaco immune data: The Monaco reference consists of bulk RNA-seq samples of sorted immune cell populations from GSE107011.
